🔌 Hardware Hackathon Experience – BugBusteer 2.0! ⚡💡
Recently participated in BugBusteer 2.0, a hardware hackathon that pushed electronics skills to the limit! This 6-hour challenge tested technical expertise, circuit design proficiency, and problem-solving abilities under extreme time constraints. 🚀⚙️

🔥 Hackathon Rounds:
✅ Round 1: A brain-teasing electronics quiz 🧠 to assess fundamental concepts.
✅ Round 2: A high-stakes circuit simulation & PCB design challenge using Proteus & Eagle. 🖥️🔧

💡 The Challenge:
The task was to design a PCB for an automotive application, integrating multiple electronic components into a functional circuit. The real challenge? Encountering new components and learning their functionality on the fly! 😵‍💫 This involved:
🔍 Researching component datasheets 📜
🔗 Debugging circuit connections 🤯
🛠️ Optimizing PCB design for efficiency & functionality 🎯

Though the final design wasn’t completed in time, the experience provided invaluable hands-on learning in circuit design, PCB layout, and real-world problem-solving. This was just the beginning—bigger challenges ahead! 🔥🚀
